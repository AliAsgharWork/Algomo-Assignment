# Welcome the Algomo Marvel Character Search Bar

It's a Front-end project to make a auto-fill suggestion dropdown using the Marvel API as a part of Algomo's Jr Front-End Assignment.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run after installation:

### `npm start`

# Installation

## You will need to make a `.env` file with the following details:

`REACT_APP_API_KEY = [YOUR_MARVEL_API_KEY]`

`REACT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY = [YOUR_MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY]`

## Install Dependencies

`npm install crypto-js` (used for making the hash for the Marvel API)

`npm install axios@0.24.0` (For making the API Calls to Marvel)
